### 3.1 Token Utility

JANI Token provides multiple use cases, including:

#### Governance and Voting
Community participation through DAOs.

#### Staking Rewards
Incentives for long-term holders.

#### Carbon Offset Utility
Tradable credits for corporate sustainability and work with  DOVU and Guardian. For a hectares of confirmed bamboo a unique NFT is minted that backs up Jani token to co2 offset activity in JANI ecosystem. This NFT will be a Co2 offset meme which will be burnt annually. It will serve as a measure for co2 offset in Jani ecosystem especially in the Jani token eg 1 Jani token is 10 kg of co2 offset annually and it will increase depending on co2 offset activities annually and growth of planted bamboo.A Farmers will be paid in Jani token for their co2 offset activities eg Jani Validators can tokenise his tea farm and from that he can earn some thing. This will be a way of rewarding and unlock liquidity that lying idle utilizing distributed ledger  technology.

#### NFT-based Conservation Tracking
Unique digital assets linked to conservation projects.

Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, and addressing it requires more than just scientific solutions—it demands creativity, innovation, and community engagement. Art has the unique power to inspire, educate, and mobilize people in ways that data alone cannot. By blending artistic expression with cutting-edge technology, we can create new pathways for environmental advocacy and action.

Our NFT project are rooted in this belief. Through digital art, we aim to raise awareness about the urgency of climate change and the importance of sustainable practices. Each NFT serves as a visual narrative, telling the story of our planet's fragile ecosystems and the need for collective action. By leveraging distributed ledger technology, we ensure transparency and traceability, allowing supporters to see the direct impact of their contributions.

This ideology is incorporated in JANI Ecosystem, which uses distributed ledger to incentivize conservation and reforestation. Just as JANI Token connects environmental restoration with financial rewards, our NFTs bridge art and activism, offering a creative way to support climate action. Together, we can harness the power of art and technology to inspire a global movement towards a more sustainable future.

A conservation NFT will be minted after 100 Jani tokens are minted. Different wallet address that support Jani activities will be given a chance to mint an NFT but must stake Jani tokens. Artist, Generative AI and even photographers will be given a chance to be creative and mint a 1 of 1 NFT. NFT allotment will depend on different factors eg bidding through lock up staking for liquidity, Lottery, Jani proof of work metrics, social media voting, buying a slot, liquidity provision metric, donations etc. Depending on how the NFT allotment process the NFT it can be Stored in a vault, Kept by the owner, Redeemed by the NFT holder, Destroyed after tokenization, Used Separately from the NFT. Join us in this innovative journey, where creativity meets conservation, and every piece of art becomes a step towards healing our planet.

#### Ecosystem Services Payments and Real World Payment
Financial rewards for conservation activities and increased utility for users for their day to day life.

#### Corporate Certifications
Recognition for companies supporting conservation efforts. Companies that donate and support will receive special certificate in NFT and physical copies that indicate that they are ESG compliant and support Jani ecosystem. Companies that lumber or log wood can pay us to plant trees that they mostly partake logging and we can plant them due to the respective nature of our businesses and still conserve the environment. Automotives and companies that emit co2 can purchase Jani token to show their commitment in reducing their carbon footprint efforts and can stake and earn rewards. JANI financial utility down to its basic state will be a unit of account a nominal unit of measure to hold value of the item it will be a medium of exchange and a store of value.

### 3.2 Token Distribution & Inflation Control

- **Initial Supply:** 50 million JANI tokens
- **Annual Minting Cap:** 1 million tokens

#### Minted Token Allocation:

**50% - Staking Rewards**
The network shall be the pool operator and will be in charge of managing the pool and setting the pool fee. The annual staking rewards will be a percentage of the total supply. Slashing conditions will be for malicious actors. Penalty for early withdrawal is no reward. Coins can be locked for at least 21 days. One can join as an individual or joint if it is a group since there will be different pool groups. Minimum staking will be 1 coins. Ecosystem builders will earn more staking rewards eg validators, auditors local stake holders compared to other parties.

Stackers reward = stackers contribution / total staked in pool * total reward - pool fee

Example: If the total reward earned by the pool is 1000 coins and the pool fee is 50 coins and the total staked by the pool 10,000 coins and the stakers contribution is 500 coins he will earn 47.5 coins in 42 days.

Annually the staking reward will be stackers contribution / total staked in network * total stacking reward

**40% - Tree-planting Fund**
The global DAO shall decide which conservation project shall get the allocation.

**10% - Liquidity Incentives**
Liquidity providers will be rewarded for their liquidity provision on DEXes.

### 3.3 Deflationary Mechanisms

- **Token Reinvestment:** 2% of each transaction will be used in conservation NFT projects
- **Buyback Program:** 10% of transaction fees reinvested in buybacks and fund bamboo projects
- **Insurance:** 3% of transaction fees will be used for insurance against any unforeseen risk that may occur in the seedlings nursery or when planted in the field eg Dying plants, vandalized plants etc.

The rest of the transaction fees will be used in the network system infrastructure, Stable Jani liquidity and for overcollateralization for good risk management in network liquidity.

# JANI TOKEN CONSENSUS MECHANISM

## Overview

A consensus mechanism is a method used in blockchain networks to achieve agreement on the state of the ledger among distributed participants. It ensures that all copies of the blockchain remain synchronized and that transactions are validated securely without a central authority.

A Proof of Growth (PoG) consensus mechanism is designed to reward participants based on measurable, real-world growth metrics.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection

**(a) Nursery Reporting**
Nurseries report tree planting and growth data. Before seedlings are planted to their designated places, the nursery tree ledger sends data to the smart contracts that a seedling will be planted to a specific location within the conservation locality. The tree planter validator records: time of planting, temperature etc.

**(b) Smart Contract Validation**
Smart contracts validate reports against GPS locations, timestamps, and sensor data. The exact location of the seedling is relayed that a seedling is planted.

### 2. Verification

**(a) Multi-Validator System**
At the time a seedling is planted at least 2 tree planter validators must be present to validate the transaction. An AI and a third-party validators confirm the accuracy of data. Community validators can stake tokens to verify growth (disincentivizing fraud). Daily (periodically) validators check up on the tree planted will be taking photos and data will be relayed to the ledger and confirmed as transactions.

### 3. Reward Distribution

**(a) Metric-Based Token Issuance**
Tokens are issued based on predefined metrics (tree survival rate, carbon offset, biodiversity impact).

**(b) Ecosystem Integration**
These tokens can be used for grants, funding, or exchange within the ecosystem.

### 4. Decentralized Monitoring & Auditing

**(a) Transparency**
Government bodies, NGOs, and community stakeholders can verify progress transparently.

## Proof of Growth (PoG) Consensus Mechanism Framework

### 1. Overview

The **Proof of Growth (PoG)** consensus mechanism rewards nurseries based on the verified growth and survival of trees. This framework outlines how smart contracts, data collection, verification, and reward distribution will work within the **JANI ecosystem**.

### 2. Smart Contract Logic

#### 2.1 Smart Contract Components

- **Nursery Registration:** Smart contract stores nursery details (location, name, unique ID)
- **Tree Growth Data Submission:** Nurseries submit growth data periodically (e.g., photos, sensor data, satellite verification)
- **Validator Staking & Verification:** Validators (community, AI, and third parties) stake tokens to verify growth reports
- **Reward Distribution:** Smart contract calculates and issues PoG tokens based on verified data
- **Dispute Resolution:** If disputes arise, an arbitration process using multiple validators is triggered



### 3. Data Collection & Verification
🔹 How it Works

A validator sends a POST request:

{
  "treeId": "T1234",
  "species": "Acacia",
  "gps": [1.2921, 36.8219],
  "plantedBy": "walletXYZ",
  "validator": "Austin",
  "status": "Growing"
}


Express hashes this record.

MongoDB saves the full record + hash.

Hedera stores the hash + validator info in the Consensus Service.

Later, anyone can verify the record by recomputing the hash and comparing it with Hedera’s log.

#### 3.1 Data Sources

- **IoT Sensors:** Track soil moisture, growth rate, and CO2 absorption
- **Satellite Imagery & Drone Footage:** Cross-check reported tree counts
- **Periodic Audits & Community Validation:** Random site visits by auditors or validators

#### 3.2 Fraud Prevention Measures

- **Multi-source verification:** A report is only accepted if multiple sources confirm it
- **Stake Slashing:** Validators providing false confirmations lose their staked tokens
- **Reputation System:** Validators and nurseries are ranked based on accuracy and consistency

### 4. Reward Mechanism

#### 4.1 PoG Token Distribution

- **Base Reward:** Nurseries earn PoG tokens per verified tree growth milestone (e.g., 6 months, 1 year)
- **Carbon Offset Bonus:** Extra rewards for CO2 absorbed, measured via IoT sensors
- **Biodiversity Impact Reward:** Higher rewards for nurseries with diverse native species

#### 4.2 Token Utility

- **Grants & Funding:** Used for expanding nurseries or purchasing equipment
- **Carbon Offset:** Exchanged for real-world environmental impact incentives
- **Community Governance:** Used in voting for protocol upgrades or dispute resolution

### 5. Governance & Scalability

#### 5.1 Community-Led Decision Making

- DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) governs protocol updates
- Token holders vote on key decisions eg validation rules

#### 5.2 Expansion & Integration

- **API for Government & NGO Integration:** Enables easy data sharing with environmental organizations
- **Mobile App Interface:** User-friendly dashboard for nurseries and validators

## Hybrid PoS-PoG Model

I will integrate PoG into HEDERA  by adding growth-based conditions for validator participation. This means that validators don't just stake tokens but must also prove real-world environmental contributions.

### How It Works

#### 1. Validator Selection (Staking + Growth)

**(a) Token Staking**
Validators must stake tokens like in PoS.

**(b) Environmental Contribution Proof**
They must also prove they've contributed to tree nursery growth or on field activity. This could involve submitting verifiable data (images, IoT sensors, smart contract logs, satellite verification, etc.).

#### 2. Block Validation & Rewards

**(a) Eligibility Criteria**
Validators who meet both staking and growth criteria are allowed to participate in block validation.

**(b) Combined Reward System**
Rewards are distributed based on a combination of:
- (i) Stake size (like PoS)
- (ii) Proof of Growth contributions (e.g., verified trees planted, CO₂ offset)

#### 3. Slashing & Reputation

**(a) Penalty System**
Validators who fake growth data or don't meet sustainability targets could:

**(b) Consequences**
- Get slashed (lose part of their stake)
- Lose validator status
- Face on-chain penalties (e.g., reduced future rewards)

#### 4. Data Validation Mechanisms

**(a) AI-Powered Verification**
Use AI-powered verification (e.g., satellite imagery, drone scans, images, use of oracles and AI agents).

**(b) Community Consensus**
Require community consensus or NGO oversight for validation.

**(c) Oracle Integration**
Implement oracles that provide real-world environmental data.

---

## Permissioned Validator Model (Certified PoG)

✔ Only verified members (CFA nurseries, organizations, government-approved groups) can be validators.

✔ Prevents spam and Sybil attacks by ensuring all validators are real contributors.

✔ Ideal for early-stage adoption before transitioning to full decentralization.

### Requirements for Validators

- Must be a registered CFA nursery or environmental group
- Must stake tokens and show consistent growth records

# Tera Farm Framework: Replanting Food Sovereignty Through Decentralization

Terra Farm is a decentralized farming agency developed by Bankai Labs within the Hisa Ecosystem, created to tackle the deeply rooted issues of food insecurity, rural poverty, and disconnected food systems. Born from the belief that food is not just a need but a right, Tera Farm bridges smallholder farmers to a digitized economy—one that is fair, transparent, and rooted in community.Terra farm uses hedera distributed ledger in supply chain tracking to enable  users of products track the source of the food product being consumed . 

We believe that with today's technological advancements, every person should access healthy, natural food. Our goal is to make this accessible, locally grown, and fairly priced food a daily reality. And at the heart of this transformation are the Terraform Units—living nodes in a decentralized network of farms powered by Hedera Hashgraph.

---

## 🌾 What is a Terraform Unit?

A **Terraform** is a GPS-mapped, tokenized farm that operates as both an agricultural producer and conservation node:

- **Digital Identity**: Registered on-chain with precise boundaries
- **Dual Tokens**: $CROP_TOK (harvests) + JANI_TOK (conservation)
- **Access**: USSD, mobile app, web—no blockchain expertise needed
- **Conservation**: Automatic participation in JANI environmental programs

*Example: A Kilifi mango farmer tokenizes harvest as $MANGO_TOK while earning JANI_TOK for community borehole maintenance.*
